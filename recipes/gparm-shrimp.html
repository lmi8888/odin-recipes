  <h1>Garlic-Parmesan Shrimp</h1>
  <img width=300px height=300px src="gparm-shrimp.jpg" alt="Dish of Garlic Parmesan Shrimp" />
  <p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough of it! I would suggest
    doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted, or more to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking
      spray.</li>
    <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and
      shake to
      mix ingredients together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>
    <li>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread crumb mixture remaining in the bag. Drizzle
      melted
      butter over the top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch to broil setting until topping is
      light
      brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
